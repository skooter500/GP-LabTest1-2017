What is happening:

- The key and player spawn at random positions in the bottom half of the screen
- The player character is controlled with the up, down, left and right keys
- The star positions are stored in 2 arrays of floats. You should give these initial values in the setup function and draw them in the draw function
- The door of the house is drawn in red initially. The player should collect the key and then go to the door.
- When the player has the key and goes to the door it should be drawn in black to indicate that it is open and the key should reappear randomly in the bottom half of the screen
- A message is shown in the top left of the screen that indicates what the player should do next
- To get full marks in the test, you should use variables and functions in your solution
